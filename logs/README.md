# CS2 Inspect Service Logs

This directory contains log files generated by the CS2 Inspect Service Go application.

## Log Format

Log files are named using the following format:

```
cs2-inspect-YYYY-MM-DD.log
```

Where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date when the log file was created.

## Log Levels

The logs include the following levels:

- `INFO`: General information about the application's operation
- `DEBUG`: Detailed information for debugging purposes
- `WARNING`: Warnings that don't prevent the application from running
- `ERROR`: Errors that may affect the application's functionality

## Configuration

Logging behavior can be configured using the following environment variables:

| Variable     | Description                                                | Default |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `LOG_DIR`    | Directory where log files are stored                       | `logs`  |
| `LOG_DETAIL` | Enable detailed logging with file and function information | `false` |
| `LOG_COLOR`  | Enable colored output in console logs                      | `true`  |

## Log Rotation

Log files are automatically rotated daily. Each day, a new log file is created with the current date in the filename.

## Docker Configuration

When running in Docker, logs are stored in the `/shared/inspect/logs` directory, which is mounted as a volume from the host system.
